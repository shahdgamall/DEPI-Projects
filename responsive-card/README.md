# Responsive card

- this project was done as a practice of media queries and flexbox and how to make it responsive in different screen sizes.
- I started this project with doing a simple UI design of the cards I want before developing it.

## What I have learned:
- css is responsive until we make it not so we try to make it responsive again as kevin powell has said in one of his videos.
- avoid height as possible as you can, instead use padding.
- instead of bad look of `flex-wrap: wrap; ` we can use `flex-direction: column;` instead to have better look with smaller screens.

## The design:
